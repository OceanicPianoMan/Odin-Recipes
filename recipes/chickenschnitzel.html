    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Think you can't make chicken schnitzel without frying? Think again! This baked recipe imitates that deep-fried 
    feel without using a ton of oil. All you need is to employ a couple simple hacks â€” 
    heat the pan beforehand and drizzle the chicken with olive oil twice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired</li>
      <li>6 chicken breasts, cut in galf lengthwise (butterflied)</li>
      <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 large lemon, zested</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>

      <li>Preheat oven to 425F or 220C</li>
      <li>Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil</li>

      <li>Place 2 chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a solid, level surface</li>

      <li>Season both sides with salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Mix flour and paprike together in a shallow bowl</li>
      <li>Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper together in a second shallow bowl</li>
      <li>Mix bread crumbs and lemon zest together in a third shallow bowl</li>
      <li>Dredge one piece of chicken in flour; shake off excess</li>
      <li>Dip into beaten egg</li>
      <li>Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl</li>
      <li>Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides</li>
      <li>Place the breaded chicken, unstacked, onto a plate</li>
      <li>Repeat with remaining chicken</li>
      <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven</li>
      <li>Arrange chicken in a single layer on the hot sheet</li>
      <li>Drizzle more olive oil over each piece</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes</li>
      <li>Flip chicken and continue baking until no longer pink in the center and breading is lightly browned (5 to 6 minutes)</li>
      <li>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
